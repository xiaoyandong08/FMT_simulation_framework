An Ecological Framework to Understand the Efficacy of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation 

Package: An Ecological Framework to Understand the Efficacy of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation
The code was written on MATLAB R2018a.
Last update: November 20 2019


The package contains:

1) "network_for_Fig2.mat" stores the interaction matrix and growth rate to simulate the "healthy-diseased-restored" process.

2) Matlab scripts for simulating the FMT process 

"Plot_trajactory_for_Fig2g.m" simulates the "healthy-diseased-restored" process and generated Fig.2g in the main text.

"FMT_simulation_Framework.m" simulates the "healthy-diseased-restored" process for a given microbial ecological network.

The other Matlab scripts are functions of "FMT_simulation_Framework.m".

3) The tutorial can be found at the beginning of each scripts.
